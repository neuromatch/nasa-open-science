    "## Curriculum overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform to Open Science (TOPS) is a NASA initiative designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science. Developed by the TOPS initiative, the guidance provided by the Open Science curriculum will promote the transformation of the research landscape and the accompanying advancement of scientific discovery. The Open Science curriculum aims to introduce learners to a nuanced understanding of open science, enabling participants to better understand an open science workflow from end to end. The focus of the curriculum will be on providing learners with a basic understanding of open science, its ethos and benefits, and how to actively participate in open science communities. The course consists of 5 modules (each for 1 day of the course) being organized as a scientific workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curriculum of this course builds upon the work of others from across the globe and fields of research who paved the way to open science. Their recognition of open science as a necessary step to equalize knowledge access and catalyze research inspired NASA’s and Neuromatch Academy's owns pursuits to contribute. Best practices, performance indicators, and core principles established by the global open science community inform our current approach."
