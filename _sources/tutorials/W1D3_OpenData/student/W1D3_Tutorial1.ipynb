    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data drives science forward.** Data are stored electronically to enable further analysis and research. Digital technologies integrated into every aspect of modern scientific research have led to the production of large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open data is an essential pillar of open science. In many ways, open data is a natural expansion of open science beyond scholarly publications to include digital research outputs. It has since become an integral part of the open science movement as open data allows anyone to see, use, and verify published results. **Open data makes science more accessible, inclusive, and reproducible.** In order to support this, data needs to be made available in formats that others can use, include metadata that describes the data, and provide helpful documentation. When made available, open data enables new discoveries and unforeseen uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Considerations of Open Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are **any type of information that is collected, observed, or created in the context of research**. Today, data are increasingly stored electronically in a digital format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary (raw) data** – Primary data refers to data that are **directly collected or created by researchers**. Research questions guide the collection of the data. Typically, a researcher will formulate a question, develop a methodology and start collecting the data. Some examples of primary data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responses to interviews, questionnaires, and surveys.\n",
    "- Data acquired from recorded measurements, including remote sensing data.\n",
    "- Data acquired from physical samples and specimens form the base of many studies.\n",
    "- Data generated from models and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary & Processed data** – Secondary data typically refers to data that **is used by someone different from who collected or generated the data**. Often, this may include data that has been processed from its raw state to be more readily usable by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Published data** – Published data are the data shared to address a particular scientific study and/or for general use. While published data can overlap with primary and secondary data types, we have \"published data\" as its own category to emphasize that such datasets are ideally well-documented and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata** – Metadata is a special type of data that **describes other data or objects** (e.g., samples). They are often used to provide a standard set of information about a dataset to enable easy use and interpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term open data is defined in the open data handbook from the Open Knowledge Foundation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Open data are data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone – subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open Data Handbook from the Open Knowledge Foundation**\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about data in the context of this day, we focus on the data that you are preparing to share, such as data affiliated with a scientific publication, regardless of what type that is. While you could share (and many do) laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, intermediate data products, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, and similar items, these aren't usually required by funding agencies or institutions and thus won’t be in focus for this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote from a [published paper about data reuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9542848/), researchers are mostly looking for data that is \"**comprehensive, easy to obtain, easy to manipulate, and believable.**\" For these criteria to be fulfilled, the data should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be sufficiently described with appropriate metadata, which greatly affects open data reusability. There is no one-size-fits-all for metadata, as its collection is guided by your data.\n",
    "- Have the appropriate license, copyright, and citation information.\n",
    "- Have appropriate access to information.\n",
    "- Be findable in an accredited or trustworthy resource.\n",
    "- Be accompanied by a history of changes and versioning.\n",
    "- Include details of all processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all data may be shared or shared with all this information. There are different reasons why it might not be possible. However, the more information shared about data helps increase the reliability and reusability of the information."

    "### Benefits of Open Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data underpins almost all of science. Openly sharing data with others enables reproducibility, transparency, validation, reuse, and collaboration. The impacts of open data include facilitating:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Greater Good**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data plays a significant role in our day-to-day lives. Open data, in particular, has played a key role. If you pause and think about it, you may realize that open data are not only common in our society, but you might have benefited from and used open data yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each country or territory often provides open access to a variety of socioeconomic information about the population, community, and business in its jurisdiction. These data are often called **census survey data, which may include the aggregated statistics of gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, and health data of a community**. These data are often used to understand the composition of a local neighborhood and are critical to inform decisions on resource allocation to ensure the quality of life for the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><span style = \"color: orange\">Case Study:</span> Open Data Helps Provide Life-Saving Information in the Face of Climate Change</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The changing climate poses a significant risk to our daily lives and has been responsible for intensifying drought, increasing flooding, and devastating fire incidents worldwide. Open data are therefore critical in providing life-saving information to adapt to the changing climate and help assess the climate risks where we live. Government agencies have been providing public access to long-term weather and climate information for decades (e.g., National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in the U.S., UK Met Office, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). A more recent initiative stems from organizations developing value-added open-data products to advise society on the risk of a changing climate. One recent example is the flood and fire risk in the United States developed by a non-profit organization [First Street Foundation.](https://firststreet.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Policy Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><span style = \"color: orange\">Case Study:</span> Predicting Climate Change Effects in Arctic Communities</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Open data can lead to policy change that directly impacts the lives of communities, such as those destined to suffer first from the slow changes to the Arctic. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07557-4) in Nature employed [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) data to help produce maps of projected environmental changes in the Arctic. These maps helped emphasize the need for adaptation-based policies at community and regional levels to avoid stagnation of change in light of a sudden and dramatically worsening situation fueled by climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Global Emergency Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><span style = \"color: orange\">Case Study:</span> COVID-19</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world, in real time, how the collective movement of researchers sharing their data (such as [sharing of\n",
    "coronavirus genome data](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00305-7#:~:text=Other%20researchers%20say%20that%20restrictions,while%20protecting%20data%20providers)) can lead to an unprecedented number of discoveries in a relatively short amount of time. This directly impacted radical vaccine development efforts and the timely control of the COVID-19 infection. These insights will continue to pay off, with this research spurring future developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sharing has many benefits and can aid access to knowledge. However, it is important to consider where the data has come from, who should have a say in its interpretation and use, and how the data can be shared responsibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Citizen Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><span style = \"color: orange\">Case Study:</span> Water Quality Testing in Beirut</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A citizen scientist is a citizen or amateur scientist who collaborates with professional researchers to help gather or interpret data on a broader spatial and temporal scale than the researchers might be able to achieve on their own.** This outsourcing of responsibility helps members of the public engage in scientific pursuits that ultimately benefit them and allow research to be conducted on a grander scale than that might be possible with only professional researchers. Citizen science is gaining popularity and recognition as a valuable contribution to scientific advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, volunteer citizen scientists in Beirut were recruited from 50 villages to help test water quality (source: [\"Contextualizing\n",
    "Openness: Situating Open Science\"](https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/book/contextualizing-openness-situating-open-science)). These volunteers were trained to be able to conduct the tests, and in turn, not only was the data collected to inform the scientific advancements, but the citizen scientists had the opportunity to learn to better manage their water resources and were able to improve conditions, creating a mutually beneficial interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Open Data and Equitable Sharing of Knowledge**\n",
    "\n",
    "Free distribution of knowledge increases participation in science. Open data are central to fostering science that is inclusive and diverse, with direct and relevant benefits to impacted individuals and communities. This integration with communities is particularly important in the mission towards the equitable sharing of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research ecosystem where knowledge is a commodity, with the main currency in the form of published papers and hoarded datasets, exclusion from research can limit scientific progress and negatively impact community outcomes. Those excluded from traditional science resources are often from low and lower-middle-income countries. Opening our data in an inclusive and easily reusable way is one step toward the purposeful inclusion of underrepresented groups in science.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><span style = \"color: orange\">Case Study:</span> Recognition and Compensation for the Work of African Ebola Researchers</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the West African Ebola outbreak from 2014-2016, West African researchers actively worked to collect blood sample data to better understand the Ebola virus and to help put a stop to the rapid spread of the virus. However, most of the blood samples were sent overseas to the US and Europe, where researchers used those data samples to author papers about Ebola. According to the paper [\"Science under fire: Ebola researchers fight to test drugs and vaccines in a war zone\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02258-4), \"This frustrated researchers in the countries ravaged by the virus, who had hoped that studying aspects of the epidemic would strengthen their ability to respond to future infectious- disease outbreaks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By fostering a global research culture of transparency and validation, where the work of underrepresented groups is celebrated and compensated, we will create a sustainable model that ensures under-represented communities (such as women, under-represented communities, indigenous scholars, non-Anglophone scholars) a voice in how the global and nuanced narrative of science is developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open data, that are purposefully inclusive and open to scrutiny, benefit scientific innovation by allowing for a **more diverse and robust scientific process that draws from multiple perspectives**. This openness also allows for the **early identification of mistaken insights** as well as **early intervention for unforeseen harm to impacted communities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open data allows non-traditional researchers to contribute to scientific development and bring their unique insights to the table. With these benefits in mind, we should always bear in mind that Open Data requires careful consideration of its potential downsides that result from failure to provide due credit and consultation with potentially vulnerable and/or marginalized communities. The next section “Using Open Data” discusses important considerations for the responsible management, collection, and use of open data by all stakeholders."

    "\n",
    "Doing open science not only lets other people understand and reproduce your results, but lets you do so as well! Implementing open science principles like good documentation and version control helps you, potential collaborators, and everyone else to understand your results. **In 2 hours, 2 weeks, or 2 years, you will still be able to understand what you did.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific benefits of opening data for you as an individual:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will never lose access to your previous work, no matter what institute you are affiliated with. Many researchers move around institutions and organizations and by having your data publicly accessible in repositories, you will always have access to them.\n",
    "- Your data can be cited and you will get credit.\n",
    "- **Publications that include links to data are cited more**, according to a 2020 [study.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230416)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing best practices for open science can strengthen your funding proposals. Funding agencies are realizing that openly sharing research provides more return on their investment. Well-documented research products also demonstrate the quality of your work, which helps with public communication and can also attract quality collaborators.

    "#### Restrictions on Sharing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data should only be shared very carefully or not at all. Reasons not to share can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data includes a country’s military secrets or violations of national interests.\n",
    "- Data includes private medical information or an individual’s personally identifiable data.\n",
    "- Indigenous/cultural/conservation concerns.\n",
    "- Data includes intellectual property.\n",

    "*Image by Patrick Hochstenbach, CC0 1.0; image illustrates each FAIR principle*\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of data today is shared online. Although FAIR has been introduced in Day 2, Section 3, some additional details are provided below. FAIR principles help researchers make better use of, and engage with a broader audience with, their scientific data than outdated techniques would allow. **FAIR data are more valuable for science because they are easier to use.** Data can be FAIR regardless of whether it is openly shared or not. If data are openly shared, being FAIR helps with reuse and expands the scientific impact of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "FAIR principles don’t encompass comprehensive implementation instructions for every type of data but offer general insights to improve shareability and reusability. Sometimes, it takes a group effort and/or a long production process to make data and results FAIR. The process starts in the planning stage of a research project. A well-coordinated open science and data management plan is often needed for full compliance with FAIR, depending on the size and type of project the data are used for.\n",

    "A license is a legal document that tells users how they can use a particular dataset. **If you don’t license your dataset, others can’t/shouldn’t re-use it - even if you want them to!** It is imperative to understand the licensing conditions of a dataset before data reuse. Without a good understanding of what a license allows, data users may run into copyright infringement or other intellectual property issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure open reuse of your data, you can use an open license. An open license has language that describes the user’s ability to access, reuse, and redistribute the dataset. There are many types of data licenses that are open to varying degrees, and these will be discussed further in the section \"Making Open Data\"."

    "A best practice when beginning your open data journey is to create a Data Management Plan, or DMP which goes within the OSDMP. This describes how you will manage, preserve, and release data, during and after a research project. Common elements of DMPs relevant to open data include a description of the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Roles in Use, Make, Share\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals interacting with data at various points in the scientific workflow can take on different roles. It is possible that these roles can overlap depending on project requirements, the size of your team, and even funding. All should be using open data principles to perform their tasks. Generally, roles include:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  |  |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Data Users | Data users primarily discover, assess, and utilize data in research projects. |\n",
    "| Data Makers (Data Providers) | Data makers often process data collected by a project/activity and package it according to open science principles. |\n",
    "| Data Shares (Data Publishers) | Data sharers bear the responsibility of disseminating and building awareness of the data to the public. |\n",

    "### Discovering Open Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Open data can be discovered by accessing **data repositories, search portals, and publications**. A wide variety of these resources are available. A key step is identifying the appropriate search terms for your application. Learning community-specific nomenclature and standards can accelerate your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to Start Your Search\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple pathways to find research data, and you should be practiced in all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/neuromatch/nasa-open-science/blob/main/tutorials/W1D3_OpenData/static/image21.png?raw=true\" width = 600 alt = \"Data sources.\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### People You Know (Online or In-person!)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the first and best way to find research data? **Ask your community, including your research advisor, colleagues, team members, and people online.** Knowing where to find reliable, good data is as much a skill and art as any lab technique. You learn this skill set by working with professionals in your field. There is no one source, no one method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Publications\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are often **attached to scholarly publications in the form of supplementary material**. Publication search engines can enable the discovery of relevant publications that you can then use to find data from a particular publication.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Data Format Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferred data formats are **community supported, machine-readable, non-proprietary, modifiable, and open**. It might seem like there are as many data formats as there are different types of data. When you think about selecting a data format, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the format compatible with your data type, shape, and size?\n",
    "- Does the data format have adequate metadata support?\n",
    "- Are there tools readily available or any specialized tools are required for reading the data format?\n",
    "- Is the data format routinely used in your field? Community standards ensure compatibility, interoperability, and ease of use when exchanging or sharing data among researchers or organizations of the same community.\n",

    "\n",
    "Investigate if your funding agency, institutions, and/or data repository has additional requirements for or guidance on data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Open Data Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-open (unsupported and closed/proprietary) data format refers to a file format that is not freely accessible, standardized, or widely supported by different software applications. Here are some examples of closed/proprietary data formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adobe Photoshop (.psd):** The default proprietary file format for Adobe Photoshop, a popular image editing software.\n",
    "- **AutoCAD Drawing (.dwg):** A proprietary data format used for computer-aided design (CAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Software applications that can read but not create DOC, PSD, or DWG formatted data usually do not fully support all the features, layers, specifications, and inner workings of the original file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some challenges of using data in non-open formats include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trouble opening the file due to compatibility issues.\n",
    "- The need to install additional software or converters, leading to frustration and inconvenience.\n",
    "- Initial setback dampens the enthusiasm for using your data.\n",
    "- Converting the data to a universal format can lead to unique formatting or features that do not translate well, making the data lose part of its value.\n",
    "- New open-data policies can limit the sharing of proprietary data as it is often non-compatible with the concept of easy distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Data Format Examples\n",

    "\n",
    "|  |  |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Comma Separated Values (CSV) | For simplicity, readability, compatibility, easy data exchange. |\n",
    "| Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) | For efficient storing and retrieving data, compression, multi-dimensional support. |\n",
    "| Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) | For self-describing and portability, efficient data subsetting (extract specific portions of large datasets), standardization and interoperability. |\n",
    "| Investigation-Study- Assay (ISA) model for life science studies | For structured data organization, data integration and interoperability among experiments, reproducibility and transparency. |\n",
    "| Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) | As a standard for astronomical data, flexible and extensible metadata and image headers, efficient data compression and archiving of large datasets. |\n",
    "| Common Data Format (CDF) | For self-describing format readable across multiple operating systems, programming languages, and software environments, multidimensional data, and metadata inclusion. |\n",

    "### Making the Data Reusable Through Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Documentation and Metadata for Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata and data documentation describe data so that we and others can use and better understand data. While metadata and documentation are related, there is an important distinction. **Metadata are structured, standardized, and machine-readable. Documentation is unstructured and can be any format (often a text file that accompanies the data).**\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand documentation and metadata, let’s take an example of an online recipe. Many online recipes start with a long description and history of the recipe, and perhaps cooking or baking tips for the dish, before listing ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ingredients and instructions are like metadata. They can be indexed and searched via Google and other search engines.\n",
    "- The descriptive text that includes background and context for the recipe are like documentation. They are more free-form, and not standardized.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already discussed metadata earlier in this module, but it’s important enough that we will repeat ourselves a little bit! We will also discuss other types of documentation, like README files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metadata: for Humans and Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata can facilitate the assessment of dataset quality and data sharing by answering key questions. It is also the primary way users will find information about your dataset. It includes key information on topics, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How data were collected and processed\n",
    "- What variables/parameters are included in the dataset\n",
    "- What variables are included and what variables are related to\n",
    "- Who collected the data (science team, organization, etc.)\n",
    "- How and where to find the data (e.g., DOI)\n",
    "- How to cite the data\n",
    "- Which spatio-temporal region/time the data covers\n",
    "- Any legal, guideline, or standard information about the data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Add Metadata?\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata enhances searchability and findability of the data by potentially allowing both humans and machines to read and interpret datasets. Benefits to creating metadata about your data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps users understand what the data are and if/how they can use/cite it.\n",
    "- Helps users find the data, particularly when metadata is machine-readable and standardized.\n",
    "- Can make analysis easier with software tools that interpret standardized metadata (e.g. Xarray).\n",
    "\n",
    "To be machine-readable, the metadata needs to be standardized. See an example of a community-accepted standard for labeling climate datasets with the [CF Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also software packages that can read metadata and enhance the user experience significantly as a result. For instance, [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html) is an open-source, community developed software package that is widely used in the climate and biomedical fields, among many others. According to their website, \"Xarray makes working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays in Python simple, efficient, and fun!\". It's the \"labeled\" part where standardized metadata comes in! Xarray can interpret variable and dimension names without user input, making the workflow easier and less prone to making mistakes (e.g. users don’t have to remember which axis is \"time\" - they just need to call the axis with the label \"time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Many standards exist for metadata fields and structure to describe general data information. Use a standard from your domain when applicable, or one that is requested by your data repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metadata Tagging Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful and informative metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses standards that are commonly used in your field.\n",
    "- Complies with FAIR Principles.\n",
    "- Is as descriptive as possible.\n",
    "- Is self-describing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the more metadata you add, the easier it will be for users of your data to use it effectively. When in doubt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seek and comply with repository/community standards.\n",
    "- Investigate open science online resources for metadata, e.g., [Turing Way.](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accompanying Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating your data, in addition to adding metadata, it is a best practice to create a document that users can refer to. The document can be done as a README file, a user guide, or even a quick start (or all three).\n",
    "\n",
    "README and other documentation files can include information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contact information\n",
    "- Information about variables\n",
    "- Information about uncertainty\n",
    "- Data collection methods\n",
    "- Versioning and license references\n",
    "- Information about the structure and file naming of the data\n",
    "- References to publications that describe the dataset and/or it's processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent is to help users quickly understand how they might use the data and to answer any commonly asked questions about your data. You can read more information and view a README template along with an example (particularly relevant for the medical sciences) at [this Harvard Medical School website.](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/collect-analyze/documentation-metadata/readme-files)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Versioning Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish a versioning schema for your data. This is a method for keeping track of iterations of data that features track changes and the ability to revert to a previous revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper versioning generates a changed copy of a data object that is uniquely labeled with a version number. This enables users to track changes and correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper versioning preserves data quality and provenance (the origin, history, and processing steps that lead to the dataset) by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing a record of traceability from the data's source through all aspects of its transmission, storage, and processing to its final form.\n",
    "- Saving data files at key steps along the way.\n",
    "- Aiming for downstream verification/validation of original findings."

    "If you don't license your work, others can’t/shouldn’t re-use it - even if you want them to. As mentioned previously in this module, a license is a legal document that tells users how they can use the dataset. It is important to understand the licensing conditions of a dataset before data reuse to avoid any copyright infringement or other intellectual property issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A dataset without a license does not necessarily mean that the data is open.** Using a license-less dataset may pose an ethical dilemma. Contacting the data creator and getting explicit permission while suggesting they apply for a license is the best path forward.\n",

    "There are several different types of licenses that build on each other. **Creative Commons (CC) licenses are often used for datasets.** CC0 (also known as \"public domain\") is the license that allows for the most reuse because it has the least restrictions on what users can do with it. **Although the CC0 license does not explicitly require citation, you should still follow community best practices and cite the data source.** CC-BY is another common license used for scientific data that requires citation. From there, you can add restrictions around commercial use, the ability to adapt or modify the data, or requirements to share with the same license. These other flavors all reduce usability by adding restrictions, such that other scientists may be unable to use the data because of institutional or legal restrictions. Funding agencies may require the use of a specific license. For public agencies, this is often CC-0 or CC-BY, to maximize their return on investment and ensure the widest possible re-use.\n",

    "### Data Sharing Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing data is a critical part of increasing the reproducibility of results. Whether it's new data we collect ourselves or data that we process in order to do our analysis, we end up sharing some form of data. We need to think about what data we will share and how to best ensure that it will be open and usable by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sharing should typically be done through a long-term data center or repository, which will be responsible for ingesting, curating, and distributing/publishing your open data. You are responsible for providing information/metadata to help make your data be readily discoverable, accessible, and citable. The cost of archiving and publishing data should also be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, sharing your open data requires the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your data **can be shared**\n",
    "2. Select or **identify a repository** to host your data\n",
    "3. **Work with your repository** to follow their process and meet their requirements\n",
    "4. Make sure your **data is findable and accessible** through the repository and is maintained and archived\n",
    "5. **Request a DOI** for your data set so that it is easily citable\n",
    "6. Choose a **data license**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may be able to work with a well-staffed repository that will handle many of these steps for you (for instance, if you are working with NASA mission data). Otherwise, it is your responsibility to follow the above steps to share your data openly."

    "### When and If to Share Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Share Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision of when to share should be discussed with everyone on the team and documented in the data management plan. Funding agencies and organizations may have specific requirements about when data must be shared, but here, we encourage you to think about whether it is feasible or possible to share even earlier than required by your funder. There are different times when data could be shared:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Sharing: Sharing at the time of collection or soon after. Some funding agencies require this or allow for a short ‘embargo’ period, but a reason (quality checks, calibrations, etc.) is usually required. This maximizes data reuse and impact and can result in increased collaborations.\n",
    "- Intermediate Sharing: At the time of publication. Many publications (and some funding agencies) require sharing data that is needed to reproduce results at the time of publication.\n",
    "- Minimum Sharing: End of grant. All scientifically useful data should be shared by the end of the research grant.\n",
    "- No Sharing: There are many reasons data should either be restricted or not shared at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously in this curriculum, there are many benefits to sharing as early as possible. Early (advanced) sharing can lead to new and unexpected discoveries and expand your collaboration network. **Remember that even when you share data, you are still the world expert on that data! So often, when people want to work with the data, they will reach out to you to collaborate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Should the Data be Shared?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before datasets are shared, it's important to consider any restrictions to your permission to share and ensure that your contributors – including sample and data donors – approve its release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. Opening our data is a powerful way to enable discovery, transparency, and scientific progress. However, you may want to consider a couple of points before data is shared:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some data are subject to laws, regulations, and policies which limit the release of the data.\n",
    "- Your local institution may have additional policies and resources – investigate them early and often.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verify Your Data is Sharable\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you decide where to share your data, you must make sure you can share your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data needs to be as open as possible and as closed as necessary...\n",
    "\n",

    "- But, some data are subject to laws, regulations, and policies that limit the release of the data\n",
    "- Your local institution may have additional policies and resources – investigate them early and often\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific considerations that might prevent the sharing of your data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A country's military secrets or violations of national interests\n",
    "- Private medical information or an individual’s personal data\n",
    "- Indigenous/cultural/conservation concerns\n",
    "- Intellectual Property, Patented\n",
    "- Other - please think about what you are sharing and the implications of sharing it (for example - do you have permission from everyone involved?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first module of this curriculum, we listed several reasons why certain research products should not be shared. We will review some of these reasons and go into more detail on a few that are particularly relevant to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Export and Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant laws and regulations that may prevent the release of data include but are not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [International Traffic in Arms Regulation](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_public_portal_itar_landing) (ITAR), which regulates the manufacture, sale, distribution, and export of defense-related articles and services.\n",
    "- [Export Administration Regulations](https://www.bis.gov/regulations/ear-overview) (EAR), which regulates the manufacture, sale, distribution, and export of commercial and dual-use items, technology, and information not already covered by ITAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Controlled Information Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some regulations and policies that may prevent the sharing of data include but are not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) (HIPAA), which established standards to protect sensitive patient health information from disclosure.\n",
    "- [Controlled Unclassified Information](https://www.archives.gov/cui) provides standards for handling unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls consistent with laws, federal regulations, and policies.\n",
    "- Federal laws and regulations governing [classified information](https://www.archives.gov/isoo/faqs) or security requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intellectual Property Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Data may be subject to intellectual property, copyright, and licensing concerns. A few of the relevant regulations and policies include patent or intellectual property laws, including the [Bayh-Dole Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap18.htm), which enables universities, nonprofit research institutions, and small businesses to own, patent, and commercialize inventions developed under federally funded research programs.\n",

    "### Where to Share Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be shared in a variety of locations. While sharing data via email or websites is popular, they are not recommended as they do not meet the requirements for findability or long-term archival support. Sharing data as part of the supplemental material of a peer-reviewed publication, especially for small data sets, is acceptable in some fields. **A long-term repository that provides a permanent identifier is the best option for sharing data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting a Data Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not already have a data repository in mind, consider the following to narrow down your options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does your funding sponsor require a specific data repository?\n",
    "- Does your organization/institution recommend a specific data repository?\n",
    "- Is there a domain-specific repository that is widely used in your research field?\n",
    "- Does the repository provide open data access?\n",
    "- Do you think the tools offered by the repository for data discovery and distribution are suitable for your data and FAIR?\n",
    "- Does the repository require funding from your project, does it fit within your budget, and does it require sustained support beyond the project life cycle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Find and compare the services, benefits, and limitations of the repositories you are considering. Each repository will have its own processes and requirements for accepting and hosting your data depending on their level of funding, purpose, and user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, each repository will provide a different set of functionality and services depending on their level of funding, purpose, and user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data with privacy concerns may have additional anonymization or approval processes or restrictions on who can access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good overview of desirable characteristics presented by the White House is [given here.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05-2022-Desirable-Characteristics-of-Data-Repositories.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensuring Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Good repositories will share (or offer) your open data through standard protocols, like HTTPS or SFTP. Common ways to do this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allowing users the ability to see a list of files that they can click and download via an intuitive interface.\n",
    "- Creating a documented API for users to generate a list of file links that meet search criteria that they can download in an automated fashion (i.e., machine-to-machine data access).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, repositories can require authorization and authentication (e.g., logins with usernames/passwords) to access data. While this is allowed under FAIR principles, it may violate Open Science principles if not everyone is able to obtain a login.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working with a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Start working with a repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Repository requirements can vary widely. Always review a repository’s requirements to see what actions you need to take once you’re ready to start working with them. Also note that some repositories have staff that will help with the process of sharing data, while others rely on the user to know how to share their own data.</p>\n",
