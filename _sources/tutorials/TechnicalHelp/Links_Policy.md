## Policy

This course has a unique class attendance policy compared to other Neuromatch Academy courses.

To successfully complete the course, all participants must:

- Attend and actively participate in all five live class sessions â€“ you will not receive the certificate if you miss any of the sessions.
- Complete five short daily quizzes to assess their understanding of the material.
- Submit a post-course evaluation survey.

Participants who meet these requirements will receive an Open Science Certification from NASA, recognizing their proficiency in open science practices. This certification can be displayed on resumes, CVs, LinkedIn profiles, and more.
