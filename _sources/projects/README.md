# Professional Development

Professional development enables students to connect and expand their experiences, skills, and interests, broadening students’ perception of how they can make an impact via different career options. 


## Mentorship Program

Professionals with experience in various fields **meet with student groups live** to share their career experiences. Mentor meetings aim to inspire and expand students’ perspectives, during and after the course.
