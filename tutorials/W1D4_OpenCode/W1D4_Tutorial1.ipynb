The practice of making code openly available to the public occurs within a spectrum from more to less protected. Ethical and legal conditions can limit the degree of openness that researchers can permit. This section will introduce the critical questions to consider when determining the appropriate accessibility of code to external users along with best practices to overcome common constraints to maximize availability.

    "### Success Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does good science demand that researchers make their code open-access? Sharing your code (and data) makes it easier for others to reproduce your results, helping to validate findings and reduce resources required to duplicate experiments. As a bonus, this decision can lead to new collaborations made possible through a shared dataset and a common understanding of scientific material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many journals and funding agencies require that you share your code at the time of publication. However, the prospect of opening code up to criticism, not receiving attribution, or missing out on a result that external researchers discover can deter scientists from making their code open-access. What if people find an error? What if they criticize your coding style? What if they take your code and publish a new result without including you? This module will help you gain confidence in sharing your code by walking you through the basic details to consider when practicing open science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review some well-known examples of groups that shared their code and what the impacts were.\n",

    "\n",
    "New open-source sets of climate models incorporate features that aim to make climate research more collaborative, efficient and reliable.\n",
    "Scientists have published an open-source framework of climate models (Isca), which contains **models that are easy to obtain, completely free, documented**, and come with software to make installation and operation easier. All changes are documented and can be reverted. Therefore, anyone can easily use the same models. Although the Isca model was initially used to examine the tropical upper atmosphere, researchers from other fields of science have used it to study the life cycle of weather systems, the Indian monsoon, and the effect of volcanic eruptions on climate. New research across all of these fields was possible within only one year of the Isca’s first publication. This is how we want all of science to work!\n",

The prominent achievement on its development path was Spaun, the world's largest functional brain model (with the further extension that led to Spaun 2.0). Nengo only depends on one third-party library (more on that later in the lesson), it is easy to integrate Nengo models in arbitrary CPython programs, opening up possibilities for using neurally implemented algorithms in web services, games, and other applications.

    "### Definitions and Considerations of Open Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**All science builds on what has already been accomplished.** Code is no different. Many scientists use code to do data analysis. This process begins with the acquisition of data, either by running an experiment or model that generates data or by identifying observational data that may be useful to test a hypothesis. Next, the data is analyzed. **It is very likely that the code required to read or analyze a new data set was already created by someone.** The existing code might require some degree of modification to meet a researcher’s unique parameters. Even the development of a new model can incorporate specific elements of existing code from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding how to find and use others' code, create your own, and share it is an important part of advancing open science.** Just like good data management practices, knowing some of the details about how to share it will not only help you use it later, but also help others understand how to use and cite it so you get credit!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Code vs Software?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write \"software,\" we are actually writing text code and using an interpreter or compiler to translate it into a program that the machine can run. Code is a language that humans can type and understand. **Software is often a collection of programs, data, and other information that a computer system uses to perform specific tasks.** An example is a software library, which is a suite of data and programming code that is used to develop software programs and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Often, scientists write and publish code that helps others reproduce their results rather than creating software packages.** But many scientists aren’t starting their code from scratch. There are large open-source software libraries that scientists use and contribute to, such as scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and others. These libraries let everyone do science faster and better because they have been written, tested, and are used by thousands, if not hundreds, of thousands of people. These libraries have been widely adopted because they are open-source – which makes it easier to collaborate with anyone, anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Open Source Software\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open-source software** is distributed with its source code without cost, making it available for others to use, modify, and distribute with its original rights and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, open-source software is transparently shared in a public repository and sometimes maintained through collaboration. Open-source software development is the basis for a vast range of research software packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of license choices that can be made for open software which can allow the creator to retain various levels of ownership and rights. The choice of license impacts reuse by others. But first, let’s break down the main types of software scientists use based on their purpose by showing examples of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists use and produce a wide variety of different types of software during projects. While many researchers might just use equations in a spreadsheet, others may use open-source libraries for advanced machine learning model development and plotting results, while others may contribute to open-source libraries in their field and grow their reputation and impact that way. Here are some examples of different types of software that you might encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Purpose Software** – General purpose software is produced for wide use and not specialized scientific purposes. This includes both commercial software and open-source software. Many widely used productivity software packages are open-source success stories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linux kernel, GNU userspace, and various Linux and UNIX distributions \n",
    "- PostgreSQL – open source enterprise-grade database\n",
    "- WordPress and Apache web hosting tools\n",
    "- Firefox and Chrome\n",
    "  - Chrome's engine is Chromium, which is forked from WebKit, which was forked KHTML. This was possible because it had a license that allowed for this type of reuse. All major browsers today except Firefox can be traced back to KHTML.\n",
    "- Android operating system, among others\n",
    "  - You can look at the Android source code, but you can't modify it and install it on a device. And even if you could, you couldn't use any of the standard services (e.g. Google Store) with that. So it's \"open\" in the same sense that last night's lottery numbers are \"open\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Software** – Software delivered to individuals as part of a program or product. Examples include automated workflows, data consolidation, and role-based interfacing and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Fprime](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/) – Space mission flight software\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infrastructure Software** – Forms the central framework of computer systems, also as known as the computer's set-up foundation. Examples include operating systems, database management systems, web servers, middleware, and virtualization software.\n",

    "**Libraries** – Libraries are generic tools for implementing well-known algorithms and providing statistical analysis or visualization, which are incorporated into other software categories. Examples include:\n",
    "- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy) – Scientific computing with python\n",
    "- [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/) – Image processing algorithms in python\n",

    "- [Photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) – tools for detecting and performing photometry of astronomical sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-Use Utility Software** – Single-use utility software is written for use in unique instances, such as making a plot for a paper, or manipulating data in a specific way.

    "### Principles, Benefits, and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principles of Open Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Open software principles are derived from open-source software best practices. They establish guidelines that advance open science and aim to enhance the value and impact of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "|  |  |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Transparency | Whether you are developing software or solving a business problem, we all have access to the information and materials necessary for doing our best work. When these materials are accessible, we can build upon each other's ideas and discoveries. We can make more effective decisions and understand how those decisions affect us. |\n",
    "| Collaboration | When we're free to participate, we can enhance each other's work in unanticipated ways. When we can modify what others have shared, we unlock new possibilities. By initiating new projects together, we can solve problems that no one can solve alone. And when we implement open standards, we enable others to contribute in the future. |\n",
    "| Share early and often | **Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid discoveries.** An iterative approach leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and seek answers in new places. **You can learn by doing.** |\n",
    "| Inclusive | Good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas should win. Only by including diverse perspectives in our conversations can we be certain we've identified the best ideas, and good decision-makers continually seek those perspectives. We may not operate by consensus, but successful work determines which projects gather support and effort from the community. |\n",
    "| Community | Communities form when different people unite around a common purpose. Shared values guide decision-making, and community goals supersede individual interests and agendas. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit: [The open source way \\| Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/open-source-way)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing code enhances science because it enables reproducibility, reusability, and replicability. The decision to share code benefits the scientific community because it increases transparency, participation, and collaboration. Sharing code at any point in the research process can be valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the source code used to generate results in peer-reviewed papers should be published, cited, and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Moving to Open Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Science moves faster when researchers are able to work together, help correct errors, build on each other's results, and share resources. Sharing software is a key part of open science that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accelerates science by making it easier to use and build on software developed in previous work.\n",
    "- Minimizes the time and cost of repeated development of similar software and the reproduction of scientific computations.\n",
    "- Increases the potential number of users and developers and thus helps improve quality and trust in the software.\n",
    "- Increases the likelihood that developers gain visibility, sustainability, software quality, and advance their employability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges of Moving to Open Software\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not uncommon for research groups to spend years developing code, writing papers with the results, and gaining scientific influence by not sharing the code. Anyone new who wants to work on a similar project is at a huge disadvantage because they would have to start from scratch. Also, anyone wanting to work in that area is forced to collaborate with the group. This group retains a very real competitive advantage by keeping it closed-source. However, this approach stifles innovation and hurts scientific progress. Many funding agencies are now requiring that code is shared at the time of publication, if not before. But challenges and fears remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Openness has costs: time spent documenting, publishing, responding to users/maintenance and cleaning up/enhancing quality.\n",
    "- Effort is required to learn how to leverage the new tools and knowledge (resources are available to ease this effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you are free to deploy the open software principles and resources in your research to maximize its impact and meet the expectations of your sponsors and community while managing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways: Relating Principles to Benefits and Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Making software more open by following the principles has benefits and challenges, which are related.\n",
    "- Greater benefits typically come with greater challenges.\n",
    "- In most cases, individual scientists and society will both benefit from more open software."

    "### When Not to Share\n",
    "\n",
    "There are valid reasons that restrict a researcher’s ability to share their complete code or software packages. Some of these reasons may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code incorporates a country’s military secrets or its dissemination violates national interests or security concerns.\n",
    "- The code incorporates intellectual property or patented data and information.\n",
    "- Institutional policies or organizational regulations do not permit the sharing of code.\n",
    "- Think about what you are sharing and the implications of sharing it (for example - do you have permission from everyone involved?).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Licensing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The [collaborative data science handbook by The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing) says of restrictions to open source sharing, \"As with anything else in society, some of what you can and cannot do in software (or hardware) development is determined by the law. Licensing is, therefore, an important aspect of sharing/publishing open-source projects as it provides clarity for anyone looking to reuse an open-source project. Without licenses in place, anyone who wants to reuse it will be left with legal ambiguity as to the status of using your intellectual property.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To be considered open source, software requires a license that complies with the Open Source Definition. One criterion of this definition demands that open-source licenses \"[must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software](https://opensource.org/licenses/).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, licenses will be discussed in more detail. As you are working on a project, you may want to use code developed by others, develop your own code, and then share it. Licenses affect all aspects of this process and it is important to understand how different licenses may affect your ability to share your code at the time of publication. It is also important to consider any requirements from your funder or institution about how you license your software."

    "As your research starts using, creating, and sharing code, the SMP provides a guidebook for everyone on the project that establishes a common understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is your project sharing all code publicly or just code that goes into a publication? Will your team be contributing back to open-source projects or just writing code that builds on them to produce results? Considering these questions early will influence how much time and energy you may want to spend on documentation and how you plan to share the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Code is a Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like data, code can be shared in many different ways to increase reusability. Code can be shared without any documentation, purely as a reproducibility artifact, or code can be well-written, documented, and openly-licensed to maximize re-use. Both of these approaches have value and depend on the time, energy, and funding that researchers have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a spectrum of openness when it comes to open software that ranges from open-source software to closed-source software.\n",
    "- An example of something “in-between” could be an executable file with documentation on how the code works.\n",
    "- Some projects may be open from inception and continuously share all code throughout development. Others may share some of the code at the time of publication. Other projects may only make code available once funding ends. A variety of valid reasons factor into a project’s approach to sharing.\n",
    "- While some factors restrict the degree of openness that software can be, each step towards sharing advances the open science movement.\n",
    "- By sharing more ideas and software, communities have driven creative, scientific, and technological advancement faster than the restricted pace of closed science. Peer production and mass collaboration create more sustainable software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "While researchers and institutions may not be able to share all their code, they can make efforts to shift the openness spectrum from closed code to open-source code and software.\n",

    "A key difference with software is that the process is typically more cyclical and repetitive than with data or results. Typically, software constantly evolves. Thus, the boundaries between \"Use-Make- Share\" are less rigid and the process is typically more dynamic and circular than pre-planned/fixed and sequential."

    "What other ways can someone search for open code? As a first step, look for code that already exists because chances are that someone else has already had a similar problem and published their code online. A common way to search for existing code is with a general search engine.

    "- Software must be described with rich, searchable, and indexable metadata.\n",
    "- Software must be findable from all relevant search points\n",

    "### Assessing Open Code and Software\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you've discovered some exciting open code that might help you solve your scientific problem. Can you trust this code you discovered on the web? Will it be useful? How much time will it take to learn it? Could the code contain malware? Could you get in legal trouble for using it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** You found the “General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)” on the internet, and it looks promising. Or, you just found lots of code snippets and functions related to the Lomb-Scargle power spectrum. Now, you would like to assess these pieces of code to help you decide if you should use them. This subsection discusses some best practices for assessing if the code will help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Four General Considerations for Assessing Open Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Software assessment criteria are similar, for any level of openness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality:** Will it be useful for your scientific problem?\n",
    "- **Interoperability:** How hard will it be to use?\n",
    "- **Security:** Is it safe? Would using the software create a security risk?\n",
    "- **Licenses/restrictions:** Can you use it? Is it legal to use the software in your project?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functionality: Assessing Scientific Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Does the software meet your scientific needs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does it address your specific science question? \n",
    "- Do studies similar to yours use it?\n",
    "- What papers cite it, and how do they use it?\n",
    "- Talk to your advisors or colleagues who might have experience with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Testing the scientific compatibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the software contain scientific test cases? If so, reproduce a case that is applicable to your problem; make sure the results are as expected.\n",
    "- If you’ve done similar scientific analysis/modeling previously, reproduce your prior results with the new software. Are the results consistent?\n",
    "- Incrementally modify a given test case to address new scientific questions. Alternatively, develop your own case, if necessary, following relevant examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interoperability: Ease of Use\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is the code written in a language that you are familiar with?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be easier to use coding languages that you are familiar with and then import the code into existing software rather than try to use a new language. On the other hand, the use of existing packages and executables can accelerate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Check for good documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the README file. Does the software meet your functional requirements? Are the environmental dependencies well-defined and reasonable?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Check the evidence of interoperability with other projects and codes**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good sign if you can find evidence that the code has been used successfully by other users who have similar scientific or technical needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factors for assessing the quality of open source software\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly assess the community usage and quality of software repository, use the tools from the repository where you found it. GitHub, for example, permits a quick scan of development activity as evidenced by the number of times the code has been downloaded or ‘forked’ in GitHub parlance. You can also view the amount of activity in a community. GitHub also provides insights into the quality of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/neuromatch/nasa-open-science/blob/main/tutorials/W1D4_OpenCode/static/image291.jpg?raw=true\" width = 400 alt = \"Astropy repo.\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Importance of the README File**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example above: [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/README.rst)\n",
    "- Always the starting point when assessing software.\n",
    "- Explains what the software does, how to install and use it, or points to files with that information.\n",
    "- Assumes limited prior knowledge by the reader / potential user.\n",
    "- Includes a compatibility description, e.g., dependencies.\n",
    "- Includes usage examples and/or test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security: Considerations When Using Open Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You have found some Open Code that will help you solve your scientific problem, and it looks easy to use. However, you may still have some reservations. Perhaps you are unsure if the code poses a security risk, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risks are relatively low for small snippets of code that are easy for you to fully understand. However, you may not be able to fully understand all components of a large Open Software Package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open software is perceived to have more security risks. This is generally less of a problem for open-source code than executables because the code can be audited for security vulnerabilities by the community. How can you assess security in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consult with your institutional open software policies and IT staff\n",
    "- Use authoritative, reputable sources to minimize security risks\n",
    "- Set strict security rules and standards when using a dependency\n",
    "- Use security tools to check for vulnerabilities (e.g., [Open Worldwide Application Security</u> Project®](https://owasp.org/))\n",
    "- Avoid unsupported open-source software. Switch to actively developed components or develop it yourself\n",
    "- Check with your latest institutional policies on using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence tools\n",
    "- Use caution when using external tools with secure or closed access data. It may be possible for the external tool to publicly share what should be restricted information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Licenses\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you want to reuse some open code you discovered. It is essential to check the legal restrictions and requirements imposed on users, which are generally provided in the license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although licensing is a nuanced subject that you will learn more about in Section 3, it is useful to be aware that there are generally two classes of license: permissive and non-permissive. **Permissive licenses, most commonly Apache 2.0, MIT, or BSD, will generally allow you to use the code for your scientific research with little restriction, whereas non-permissive licenses, such as copy-left licenses, impose substantial restrictions on how you use the code and require more careful consideration.**"

The challenges associated with writing code can range in difficulty from simpler tasks, such as the use of spreadsheets, to more complex activities, such as the creation of extensive libraries and the use of high-performance or cloud computing. Code can be developed as an individual, team, or community. Once written, code might be used for decades or never again.\n",

    "### Importance of Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code will change significantly over the lifetime of your project. Just as we appreciate the ability to track earlier versions of documents or versions created by different people, inevitably, someone will want to be able to revert, compare, and synthesize changes in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular tool for version control is git. Git is a system that tracks changes in computer files, similar to Google Docs or SharePoint but more applicable to code script. Git is usually used in conjunction with a version control platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These tools were covered in Day 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control enables the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps developers keep track of changes to a project's code (as well as supplemental files and documentation) over the entire course of a project's evolution.\n",
    "- Revisions to a project's files can be tracked, including contributions made by different people.\n",
    "- Undesirable changes (like errors or bugs) can be reverted at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a good practice for coding, even if you are not immediately sharing the code. You can use version control with your code privately on your computer or use the private mode on hosting services (e.g., GitHub and GitLab). By setting up version control early on, you prepare your code for intended and unforeseen future use.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### README\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stop for a user when they approach a new project should be the README file. Aptly named, this file contains orientation information that will help a user understand a project’s purpose, provides examples of how it can be used, and lists other important information that the creator deems pertinent.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the minimum, a README should contain the name of the project and a very short paragraph of what the software is. Two to three sentences in a plain-language style that does not assume who is reading it. It’s the elevator pitch for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "|  |  |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Bad** README example | \"This code recomputes the fundamental permutation factor of the downward flow (for J < 10, obviously).\" |\n",
    "| **Good** README example | \"LeapKitten. This Python software package takes any picture of a kitten (JPEG, PNG) and uses artificial intelligence to output what it would look like leaping into the air. In addition, the code takes leap years into account on the timestamp on the image.\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the following information is helpful to add to the README, especially if they are not listed elsewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list of any code dependencies the software has, e.g. \"Numpy, kitten-rng, and human-readable must be installed to run this software.\"\n",
    "- How to install and a brief description of how to run the software.\n",
    "- Detailed description of the software, especially if there is no external documentation.\n",
    "- Examples of how to use the software.\n",
    "- Acknowledgement of team members or sources of support.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in these examples, README files can be useful for a [collection of scripts supporting a publication](https://github.com/granttremblay/Tremblay2018_Code) or an [extensively developed software package](https://github.com/MillionConcepts/lhorizon).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contributor Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The *CONTRIBUTING.md* file gives information about how to contribute to the project. It details how the contribution process works and what type of contributions are needed. While not every project has a *CONTRIBUTING.md* file, the existence of one is a clear indicator that contributions are welcomed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to decide for yourself when your project has progressed enough to consider inviting contributors. When it has, create a document called CONTRIBUTING at the top level of your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Astropy contributing guidelines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Numpy contributing guidelines](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html) provide two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Tip: Even if you are developing your code publicly, this does not mean you have to accept contributions from others or maintain your code forever. The contributing guidelines or README are good places to indicate what your expectations are for your code. This can clarify that the code is not maintained or not accepting contributions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code of Conduct\n",
    "\n",
    "The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Level Documentation for the Developer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your software should be documented within the source code. Each function should have comments at the start that briefly state, in plain language, what the function is for. This is not only for other developers, but yourself a week later when you forgot what you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\# This function takes the image array and crops it from the center to 50% of the original size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into details of the data type, calling parameters, etc. this description immediately puts someone looking at the code into the context of what the function aims to accomplish; they can then explore the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you should consider placing a description at the start of a function, use your discretion on where you put similar descriptions of code. At the start of a complex loop or analysis would be a good idea. Don’t go overboard - things like this aren’t useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\# set x to 17 \n",
    "x = 17\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive variable, class, and function names can make your code very readable. Sometimes even great coders are working fast and will name variables 'a', 'temp', or other names that probably won't make a lot of sense in a week or two when they come back to something they were working on. Names like 'baking_time' or 'velocity' are more clear. Variable names should be easy to understand and clearly represent what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, someone who doesn't write in the software language of the code can read the comments in the file and have a rough idea of what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the comments to put URLs that reference where you might have found the algorithm you’re using (e.g. Stack Overflow) or the journal paper where you found the formula you’re implementing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Level Documentation for the User\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are developing code that you expect others to use, produce a manual on how to use the code. As code constantly develops, it is much easier to document while or even before you write any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write your documentation within the code itself, there are pieces of software that can then extract it, format it, and present it as a polished manual. Examples of documentation generated from the code can be seen for [Astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/) or [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "They look fancy, but very similar too. These sites were completely generated from comments and documents written in the source code. Different from the comments written for developers of the code above, these comments were written specifically for the audience of external users of the code: the manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are multiple software packages for automatic documentation generation, the most commonly used ones are [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for Python and [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) for most everything else. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is also a popular choice for the formatting language for documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming and Documenting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Establishing a Development Environment** - Establishing an appropriate development environment will help you write good, clean code and will help you maintain the project as it evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure any necessary tools for writing the code. Perhaps an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor. Some popular examples include VS Code, Pycharm, R Studio, Xcode.\n",
    "- Set up a package manager. For example, for Python, one could use 'anaconda' or 'poetry'.\n",
    "- Create a virtual environment specific to your project to isolate its dependencies (and their versions) from those used for other projects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structuring Files and Folders** - How you structure the files in your project from the beginning will contribute to the success of the final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different programming languages have different standard folder structures. Familiarize yourself with the standards before starting, as it will help others collaborate and will likely save you from difficulties later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of sample code structures that can be used to get started. For example, for Python, there is Cookiecutter and an Astropy package template."

    "An open source license is a type of software license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as compliant with the Open Source Definition. **An open-source license grants permission for anyone to inspect, use, modify, and distribute the software’s source code for any purpose.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Licenses ensure that developers receive credit and control over how their work is used. Without a license, software is assumed copyrighted and without permission. Programmers include licenses to allow reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Licenses take various forms in order to outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contractual obligations (if any exist) between the developer and user.\n",
    "- What the user may do with the software.\n",
    "- To whom the user may distribute the software (if any such right exists).\n",
    "- Length of time the user has the right to use the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Common Types of Software License\n",
    "\n",

It’s not bad practice to put a one line version of the license at the top of each file of code as well, with a pointer to where one could find the full license.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Open-Source Software Licenses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of open-source licenses. Permissive and protective (sometimes referred to as copy-left). The difference in these types of licenses is primarily related to the type of license users of the code are allowed to apply to their derivative works.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Permissive License**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The Open Source Initiative defines a permissive software license as a license that guarantees the freedoms to use, modify, redistribute, and create derivative works. An example of this type of license is the Apache 2.0 license by the Apache Software Foundation. It is the most popular and widely used permissive license.</p>\n",
    "<p>Users have wide latitude for reuse under this license. They are generally free to incorporate the code into their project or use it how they wish. A user of permissive-license open source in a product could redeploy the open source software with a wide range of licenses, including proprietary closed source software.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Protective License**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Protective (copyleft) licenses are a legal technique of granting certain freedoms over copies of copyrighted works with the requirement that the same rights be preserved in derivative works. This allows users to reuse, but also requires users to share their changes with the community using the same license. An example of a protective license is the General Public License (GPL) that ensures users have the freedom and responsibility to share their changes with the community. It is the most widely used protective license. These types of licenses can result in less re-use by users who may prefer or be required to only use permissive licenses.</p>\n",

    "### Programming Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection, some best practices in development are provided, including code review, testing, security, and accessibility. These best practices will improve the quality of code, reproducibility of results, and security of a project. Combined, these actions help improve the robustness of open access code and help to meet the unique challenges that can arise with multiple contributors and revisions that occur over an extended period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Code benefits from peer review in the same way as science. Having someone else read over your code and test it is one of the best ways to improve the quality of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many version control platforms have built-in tools that enable developers to review, comment, and iterate on each other’s code. These can be done in the open and allow anyone to comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a great example of the discussion that can happen when the original creator of an algorithm [comments on a python implementation made by a first-time contributor to the Astropy project](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/4301). The open and constructive discussion led to a better implementation of the algorithm along with possible future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software packages can be reviewed as their own products as well. Many scientific publications now accept papers focused on software. There are entities like [PyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/) and the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) that provide open peer review of scientific packages. See more details about JOSS in the next lesson on sharing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A proven method to evaluate the reproducibility of your software is through testing. There are many types of testing that range from testing the smallest testable parts of a code to verifying if a code works as a whole under different scenarios. Code testing can include a wide range of different techniques. The following lesson section provides only a brief introduction to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of code testing is to evaluate if a code does what its authors intended it to do. Comprehensively testing code can be very difficult as it involves testing the code for generating expected outputs as well as for failing when it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Scientific validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether producing a script or an entire data processing pipeline, the validation of software is critical to ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of the scientific results. This could mean **manually calculating the results to check the output of the code, comparing it to previously produced results, or having another team member test it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reproducibility testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the same inputs and parameters, can the same results be produced? Making the configuration files, input data, etc., openly available so **users can easily run and produce the same published results** is a critical way to increase trust in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Built-in tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests enable software developers to bolster their confidence in their code’s ability to perform as expected. **Unit tests are small functions that sit outside the code base and test a specific function or run a specific test.** For example, if a function takes an image and flips it horizontally, one test might check that the resulting image is the same size. Another compares the output using a known image with the expected result. Another checks that a new image is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Automated testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in tests can usually be run both manually and automatically. Most version control platforms offer services for running tests automatically. When run this way, code can be checked to see if changes raise any problems. **This process of checking the code automatically as it is developed is called continuous development & continuous integration (CI/CD).** If a small change made in one part of the code results in an unexpected change in another part, running the tests will uncover this immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minimizing the Risk of Security Vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether using open-source, closed-source, or commercial software, it is important to consider the security risks inherent in the development of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure minimal, **DRY (Don’t repeat yourself) code** (easier to maintain and fix).\n",
    "- Use global variables or key managers for credentials. Never include credentials in your code.\n",
    "- Use well-tested and maintained dependencies. In packages that you maintain, keep the list of dependencies up to date.\n",
    "- Create software with tools that provide automated scanning and auditing.\n",
    "- If there are unsupported dependencies that you rely on, assess them to determine how they might introduce security risks and whether it would be appropriate to switch to a different package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Security tools and security vulnerabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Commercial and open-source tools have been developed to address the challenge of identifying the security vulnerabilities in different source components. If you do not have any technology to secure your open source usage, you can consider using the Dependabot or <a href=\"https://owasp.org/\">OWASP</a> dependency check tools.</p>\n",
    "<p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), is an online community that produces free tools and technologies in the field of web application security. OWASP dependency check is a utility created for developers, which identifies project dependencies and checks if they contain any known, publicly disclosed, open-source vulnerabilities.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Test components and dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Testing the security of the open-source components you are using is the best way to ensure the safety of your applications and your organization. Your commitment to timely and frequent analysis of open-source components should be the same as to your proprietary code.</p>\n",
    "<p>This is especially true as the component in question may have unknown security vulnerabilities or dependencies that differ with each use case. It is possible for a component to be secure in a particular application but vulnerable in another.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating FAIR Software\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Findable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Software includes a persistent and unique identifier and rich metadata, so it is easy for humans and machines to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Accessible**\n",
    "\n",
    "Software is retrievable from its identifier via standard communication protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Interoperable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Software interoperates with other software; it exchanges data and/or metadata via community standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reusable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully described metadata with provenance, meeting community standards. License permits reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Helpful Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some further suggestions on how to make your code more accessible, reproducible, and transparent:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  |  |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Descriptive Names** | Variables, functions, and similar entities should be given descriptive names as opposed to vague names. Descriptive names instantly give other programmers an idea of what the variable or function is. For example, the variable name **colourOfCat** is a good name because it describes what it intends to do, which is to encompass the color of a cat. |\n",
    "| **Metadata File** | Consider including a metadata file for your software to make it more discoverable. A ‘codemeta.json’ can be created using [Code Meta's generator](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/) to include with your package. |\n",
    "| **Operation Documentation** | Share details about how you are running the code. For example, document the version of a software library you are using, or the version of the compiler. These are often shared in an 'environment.yml' file. |\n",
    "| **Automation** | Consider the following scenario:<br><br>You are getting ready to publish your paper that includes 17 plots that all depend on a data set released by a mission. Right before you are about to submit, the mission releases an updated version of the data set.<br><br> How easy will it be to recreate those plots?<br><br> Software allows you to automate the running of scripts and alert programmers when written so that input files are not hardcoding. This allows programmers to easily re-run code if an initial parameter changes. |\n",
    "| **Using Standards** | Most languages have their own coding style adopted by their respective communities. Following those conventions makes it easier for others to contribute to your code and makes your project more inclusive. |\n",
    "| **Portability** | Allows individuals the ability to transfer their personal data between platforms. |\n",
    "| **Naming** | Many historical terms used in software have negative connotations depending on the context. When considering different terms or naming, consider how different audiences may react to those terms. |"

    "\n",
    "**Open software communities are social learning spaces where individuals come together to learn a new skill, exchange knowledge and experiences, and then apply what they've learned from the community in their day-to-day work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Communities offer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A low entry point for learning and improving your use of software in research.\n",
    "- An opportunity to share individual experiences, identify common hurdles, and iteratively enhance knowledge and resolve problems.\n",
    "- A way to build the culture around open source software in science and a great way to keep updated on the latest tools and practices.\n",
    "- A non-hierarchical community of practice where all members of the community should be treated equally.\n",

    "### Contribute to Open-Source Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributing to open software provides many advantages and opens doors to a number of rewarding opportunities. There are few other industries that can boast the massive number of global contributions that the open-source community can. Contributing to open-source software is a great way to improve your coding skills and document your work while growing your community.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of contributing to open software. Not all of them require writing actual code:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  |  |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Add New Features** | The most obvious case for contributing to open software is enhancing its usability by adding new features. |\n",
    "| **Fix Bugs** | Alternatively, you can reply to an already opened issue by fixing it. |\n",
    "| **Report Issues and Make Suggestions About Improving Code** | Reporting an issue is a valuable contribution, even if you don't know how to fix it. For example, you might be using a different browser in which the software has not been tested yet, have discovered a particularly uninformative error message, or be unable to feed a valuable user experience back to the developers that can help to improve the overall usability of the software. |\n",
    "| **Improving and Contributing to Documentation** | Contributing to documentation constitutes a great starting point for contributing to open-source software and is often overlooked in its importance. Writing documentation allows you to familiarize yourself with the use of the software while helping to teach others. |\n",
    "| **Create Tutorials, Use Cases, or Visuals** | Another way to contribute is to make your experience and use of the software publicly available. For example, you could create a tutorial based on your use of the software, summarize a use case, or provide a summary of your use in a graphic. This part of contribution is particularly appealing as it does not create much extra work to just publish what you have used the software for. |\n",
    "| **Improve Layout, Automatization, Structure of Code** | Apart from creating new code, a good way to contribute to open-source software can also be to improve, restructure or automatize existing code. This is called refactoring and helps to make the software project more effective and stable. |\n",
    "| **Organize and Attend a Community Meet-Up** | Another way to contribute to open-source software is via community building. Many software products and toolboxes have a lively community of users that meet on a regular basis in person and online to discuss and improve the software and its use. Participating in or even organizing such a meetup can be a good way to improve your knowledge of the software, get to know its community, and contribute to open-source projects. |\n",
    "| **Code Review** | Requests to integrate new contributions into the main code base usually require a review of the contribution by at least one other user. Similar to peer review, code review entails writing a short summary about the quality of the code and making suggestions about improvements. |"
