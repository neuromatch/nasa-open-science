NASA's **Transform to Open Science** program emphasizes sharing guidelines and best practices that apply to its diverse research efforts, cultivating a culture of openness. NASA's commitment to open science enhances **collaboration** across various research domains, from astrobiology to physics, allowing broader access to important scientific information. NASA **datasets** include biology, chemistry, environmental science, geology, and other fields related to robotic and human planetary exploration, stellar evolution, and the search for extraterrestrial life.\n",

    "Open science practices and principles can be applied to all stages of the research process. One early example of NASA's efforts to involve more people in science is the [exoplanet citizen science projects](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/citizen-science/), with the **[Exoplanet Explorers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers)** being a significant part of this effort.\n",

    "### Why Should We Do Open Science Now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Science and science communication increasingly face severe pushback from the public because of inadequacies in the reproducibility of results and the spread of misinformation, respectively, that foster mistrust. The practice of open science counteracts this by involving community feedback to validate results in a more robust manner and combats misinformation **by making results available to the public**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reproducibility Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Science becomes more robust and accurate when scientists validate their colleagues' results. However, the rapidly-growing pool of published research presents an overwhelming challenge to reproduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 2011, the AAAS, publisher of Science, began requiring the authors of computational research reports to share data and software upon request.\n",
    "- In 2018, a [research study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115) was carried out that investigated 204 articles for reproducibility and that were published in the journal Science after 2011. It was found that **only 26% of papers were able to be reproduced**, with the two primary reasons being the inability to get access to the data and software and the fact that the methods were not described in sufficient detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Study: Open Results Enable Iteration and Improve Error-Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at an example of how closed science can restrict research impact by [following the outcome](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1318&context=usdeptcommercepub) of a highly cited journal article to understand how science functions to inform a field’s state of research, the decisions of policymakers, and the actions of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/neuromatch/nasa-open-science/blob/main/tutorials/W1D1_TheEthosOfOpenScience/static/image220.png?raw=true\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\" alt = \"The global cooling error timelime\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1990 analysis of satellite data on climate temperature concluded that the upper troposphere experienced no warming, a **finding that contradicted early climate models predictions**. Policymakers concluded from this result that researchers don't understand climate models enough to warrant changes in environmental policy. The processed data from this study were made open-access but, as was typical for the time, **neither the original data nor the code used for processing and analyzing the data were shared** by the original research team. Eight years after the article was published, other scientists noticed that the original authors didn't account for several important effects. This oversight introduced errors into the dataset and falsely produced artificial cooling to the temperature measurements. It took another five years and additional funding to reproduce the code and conduct a new analysis. **Thirteen years after the original paper, it was confirmed that the upper troposphere was warming and agreed with climate model predictions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Learn about the layers of Earth's atmosphere [here](https://www.sciencefacts.net/layers-of-atmosphere.html).*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The inability for the scientific community to access an article’s original data and code slows the pace of discovery**, thirteen years in this case, and forces other research teams to repeat the work (code) instead of moving on to new projects. This isn't the pace that we want to advance science, with one step forward and two steps back to iterate and resolve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intentions of the original research group were not to conceal or prevent access to their data and methods; **the community norms at that time simply did not include the sharing of data and software openly**. This is, in part, because it allows researchers to keep a competitive advantage when seeking funding opportunities. In this case, the research group simply followed this common practice. This culture of closed science needs to be changed because the **practice of withholding code (or data or other research artifacts) can stifle scientific progress**. In the climate change example, a flawed study could have swiftly been corrected by open peer feedback but it instead undermined the credibility of climate scientists. The cost to progress on climate change research and the prevented benefit to society was enormous. It is imperative to shift the entire science ecosystem, policies, and rewards toward the prioritization of openness if the full and immediate benefits of research are to be realized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of Scientific Publishing\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, scientific publishers have **charged subscription fees to access journals** and, often, article processing charges (APCs) to cover the costs of preparing a manuscript for press (even when the peer reviewers were volunteering their time). These practices limit both who could read papers and who could publish results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open access publishing has significantly increased the number of articles that are available as electronic copies online. A growing number of governments and funding agencies are starting to **mandate that research funded by taxpayers must be accessible to the public** after publication. However, the current hybrid system still does a poor job of allocating costs fairly across the research publication process (more on this in Day 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of who has access to published papers also motivates open science. [For example](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/can-science-be-more-equitable-so-everyone-enjoys-benefits-open-science-answer), even though more climate research is made available as open access than that from other scientific fields, the **majority of climate research articles, including many important ones, remain behind paywalls**. Climate misinformation is freely available to anyone online but scientific climate results are mostly hidden from the public behind paywalls. This practice does not increase trust in science.\n",

    "The Ethos of Open Science is a broad term that encompasses the moral and ethical attitudes held by individuals and institutions about practicing ‘open’ science. There is an ethical element to **sharing both new knowledge and the processes used to obtain said knowledge**. It is important to note that there is no one be-all way of practicing or conducting open science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diverse practices, assumptions, and goals are just part of the complexity of open science. There are also **divergent moral principles** that guide open science communities. Such principles are captured in **\"codes of conduct\"**. A code of conduct is a community governance mechanism that **outlines the principles and practices expected of a given research community’s members**, as well as the process for investigating and reprimanding those in violation of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, a **code of conduct constitutes the moral backbone of a research community**. However, as with the numerous schools of thought, there are similarly many codes of conduct. In other words, there is no one set of universal principles that all open science\n",
    "practitioners abide by.

    "Have you ever seen weather forecast images for your location? That data comes from NEXRAD radar stations, many of which have been operating for over 30 years. The data has always been made publicly available, but can be difficult to use. It was mostly used for rain information, so stations didn’t see a need to make it readily accessible after 24 hours. Users who wanted the historical data from NEXRAD had to work through the following arduous steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to a website.\n",
    "- Make a request (but not one too large).\n",
    "- Wait for a robot to read the data off tape storage and copy it online.\n",
    "- Receive an email with instructions on where to download a user's data.\n",
    "- Download the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The massive size of the dataset, more than 250TB, made it essentially impossible to do large-scale analysis. Nobody had the time to make these requests and download the data bit by bit.\n",
    "           \n",
    "**However, in 2015, all NEXRAD data were moved to and made freely available in the cloud. Usage of the dataset increased almost immediately!**\n",

For example, they used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/the-birds-in-the-cloud-how-the-university-of-oklahoma-uses-nexrad-data-to-study-birds/\">NEXRAD radar readings of birds to monitor flight patterns.</a> In particular, purple martins! Purple martins form huge roosts of up to 50,000 birds that can be tracked using radar. The purple martins perform stunning aerial performances that can now be tracked with the same technology previously reserved for rain measurements.\n",
    "            \n",
    "In another example of new NEXRAD uses, a NASA-led study linked variability in <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3201/climate-patterns-thousands-of-miles-away-affect-us-bird-migration/?s2=P1382021636_1683417608248277265\"> bird migration to large-scale climate patterns that originate thousands of miles away</a>. The better land managers understand current migration patterns and foresee behavioral changes in these birds due to climate change, the better they can direct their conservation and habitat restoration efforts. The newly- accessible radar data provides valuable insight needed to achieve their goals. This study was funded by NASA, uses NOAA NEXRAD data, and made fully available for the first time by the AWS Public data program."

    "<img src=\"https://github.com/neuromatch/nasa-open-science/blob/main/tutorials/W1D1_TheEthosOfOpenScience/static/image217.png?raw=true\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\" alt = \"Open science stakeholders\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific research should benefit humanity. Although open science has many stakeholders, the advantageous interaction between science and society takes place among three core groups: **scientific researchers**, **policymakers**, and **the public**. Researchers do science and share their results with policymakers and the general public to inform their decisions and improve their lives. The public helps to fund research through taxes and can provide input to future areas of study. Policymakers help to implement measures that are informed by scientific results to improve the health, environment, and livability of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three stakeholder groups remain central to the world of open science. However, the inclusive nature of open science demands participation from the broader public. Growth in public participation in science can occur by removing barriers to those historically excluded and by expanding the community of people who support scientific research itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we list some core groups who we envision as taking part in and/or benefitting from open science while being fully aware that this list is not exhaustive and the categories we choose here have very blurred boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers are often thought of as the ones who do open science to benefit others. However, researchers themselves can also greatly benefit from open science. Their work can achieve higher visibility among colleagues and the public, they receive credit for a full range of activities related to their science (including time spent sharing data and code, for instance), and they have more access to datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A team of supporters and collaborators enables this research to take place. Open science aims to include these supporting members of the scientific process and ensure they receive credit for their contribution to improving science.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Policymakers\n",
    "\n",
    "Policymakers represent another key community in the science environment. Policymakers can reference scientific findings to inform their decisions for the betterment of society. Those who help in the understanding and dissemination of these policies (including educators and science journalists) are crucial to this process. Policymakers can also play important roles in ensuring and facilitating open science by setting data management processes, encouraging open access legislation, and developing ethical guidelines for experiments. Policymakers can benefit from open science by gaining better access to scientific output via the open sharing of research results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General public\n",
    "\n",
    "The public plays a crucial role in science today as consumers of scientific results who make decisions based on, and adhere to policies shaped by, scientific results. Open science can make scientific results, data, and workflows more accessible to the public by strengthening routes of access to trustworthy sources of information, which in turn increases trust in science. The public can also take part in open science through community science projects, for example as volunteers to collect or manage data. As a result, participants boost their understanding of science and feel empowered through opportunities to exert influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open science can strengthen the connection between all of these groups. Communication between researchers and both the public and policymakers stands to drastically improve with more transparent and accessible scientific knowledge."
